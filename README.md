# How do I install PipBoy on my iDevice?
1. Download iTunes, Cydia Impactor & the latest IPA from Releases.
2. Unlock your iDevice & plug it into your computer. (Make sure your iDevice never falls asleep.)
3. Open Cydia Impactor & drag the .IPA file onto it.
4. Log into your Apple ID. (It's all sent to Apple, not us or Cydia Impactor. Don't worry!)
5. Skip the ''not PLIST_STRING'' error, that happens for all IPA's.
6. Verify the profile in Settings.
7. You should now have Pip-Boy on your iDevice?
