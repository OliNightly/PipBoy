# Pip-Boy
Your personal Pip-Boy for your iOS Device.

**WARNING:** Due to iOS's limitations, some of the features of Pip-Boy have been removed. The map will have to be a still image & I have to think of a new idea for the data & inventory tabs.

# How do I install PipBoy on my iDevice?
1. Download iTunes, Cydia Impactor & the latest IPA from Releases.
2. Unlock your iDevice & plug it into your computer. (Make sure your iDevice never falls asleep.)
3. Open Cydia Impactor & drag the .IPA file onto it.
4. Log into your Apple ID. (It's all sent to Apple, not us or Cydia Impactor. Don't worry!)
5. Skip the ``not PLIST_STRING`` error, that happens for all IPAs.
6. Verify the profile in Settings.
7. You should now have Pip-Boy on your iDevice!

If there is any updates, it should do it automatically without you even need to use Cydia Impactor.
